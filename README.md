I'm a sophomore at Washington University in St. Louis studying Computer Science with a minor in Statistics. I enjoy developing software that brings unity and growth to the lives of others.<br><br>I have gained valuable experience through Software Engineering internships at Citadel and Capital One. <br><br>Among my notable projects is [PortfolioPro](https://github.com/dani-ribeiro/PortfolioPro), a comprehensive stock portfolio management tool and financial assistant. Leveraging Python and large language models, it provides users with streamlined stock performance monitoring and intuitive insights for informed decision-making. Additionally, I've developed a [mock operating system](https://github.com/dani-ribeiro/mockos) in C++ featuring Linux and Grep commands for optimized file-traversal and pattern-matching algorithms. <br><br>Dedicated to continuous learning, I actively participate in professional development programs like Management Leadership for Tomorrow, Thrive Scholars, SEO Career, and ColorStack.
